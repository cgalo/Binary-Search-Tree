The node for this BSTree has the following information:

|Variable Name|Type           |Description  |
|-------------|:-------------:|------------:|
|*key*        |String         |Word being stored, it is case sensitive              | 
|*count*      |Integer        |Counts the frequency that the *key* has been inserted|
|*leftChild*  |Pointer        |Points to the left children node                     | 
|*rightChild* |Pointer        |Points to the right children node                    |
